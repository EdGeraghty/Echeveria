# Echeveria

[Echeveria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echeveria) is a rootless app designed for managing a phone used primarily as a HotSpot.

There's a high likelihood I'll get bored and move onto something else before it gets to the stage of being particularly
useful as an implementation.

## How2/LiterallyEven
